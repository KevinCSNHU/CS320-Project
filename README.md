## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
You can ensure your code is functional and secure by performing regular testing throughout the development of your application.  This can include unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing, among many more.
## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Users needs can be interpreted through the creation of software requirements.  The requirements can then be reviewed with the user to ensure everyone has the same understanding of what is needed.  The requirements can then be used to guide the incorporation of the users needs into the program.
## How do I approach designing software?
I approach software development by creating a set of requirements for the program to be created.  From there, I program the minimum viable product to deliver the requirements, testing my code at all major benchmarks.  This minimum viable product can then be shown to the stakeholders to ensure we are progressing in the correct direction.  From there, changes can be incorporated into the requirements and a more polished product can be created.
